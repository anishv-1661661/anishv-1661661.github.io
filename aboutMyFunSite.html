								<p>Who am I? What is this company?</p>
								<h2>The Basics</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I spend a decent amount of time, in bursts, searching online for cool wallpapers. So, to be honest, I'm just taking free stuff off the internet and trying to sell it at a cost to the unwitting. My taste of what's "cool" changes over time. Right now, I'm attracted to the more minimalistic, pastel, and gradient wallpapers. This means that the majority, if not all, of my inventory is going to be pictures of this genre. I recently recycled my picture inventory, so I don't have too many right now, but know that this is a fast growing business. I believe that there's significant demand for my product and that my prices (TBD) will be very fair.</p>

							<header class="align-center">
								<p>How do I do what I do?</p>
								<h2>The Process</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I generally grab a bunch of pictures and sort through them to see which ones I really like. I have a few criteria that I look to satisfy when I'm scraping through the interwebs. First, I don't even download anything that isn't high resolution. This is a key selling point for my products. If they're not high quality, they're not worth looking at. Second, the wallpapers have to appeal to a large audience. If I don't have customers, I can't call myself a business, now can I? Third, <i>I, personally,</i> have to like the pictures to consider selling them. My products are an important part of my reputation as a self-proclaimed wallpaper connoisseur. These are the main focus points. I obviously can't reveal my entire process; the trade secrets have to stay secrets.</p>
